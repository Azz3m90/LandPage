# Security Update - Email Credentials Protection

## Issue Fixed
The email password for `contact@fastcaisse.be` was previously hardcoded in the source code files, which posed a critical security vulnerability. This has been fixed by implementing environment variable-based configuration.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Hardcoded Credentials
- **Removed** hardcoded SMTP password from `contact-form-config.php`
- **Removed** hardcoded SMTP password from `contact-handler.php`
- **Removed** hardcoded API keys from source files

### 2. Implemented Environment Variables
- Created `.env` file with the new password (NOT committed to version control)
- Created `.env.example` file as a template (safe to commit)
- Updated PHP files to load credentials from environment variables

### 3. Updated Configuration Files
- `contact-form-config.php` now loads settings from `.env` file
- `contact-handler.php` has fallback logic to load from `.env` if config file is missing
- All sensitive data now uses `getenv()` to retrieve values

## New Password
The new SMTP password has been set to: `C/E-96T4onc2.-q`
This password is stored ONLY in the `.env` file, which is excluded from version control.

## Security Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables
- All sensitive data (passwords, API keys) are now stored in `.env` file
- `.env` file is excluded from version control via `.gitignore`
- `.env.example` provides a template without sensitive data

### 2. No Hardcoded Secrets
- Source code no longer contains any passwords or sensitive API keys
- Default values are empty strings, not actual credentials

### 3. Version Control Safety
- `.gitignore` includes `.env` to prevent accidental commits
- Only `.env.example` is committed to show required variables

## Deployment Instructions

### For Local Development
1. Ensure `.env` file exists with correct credentials
2. The application will automatically load settings from `.env`

### For Production Server
1. Create `.env` file on the server (DO NOT upload from local)
2. Set the environment variables with production credentials
3. Ensure `.env` file has restricted permissions (readable only by web server)

### Setting File Permissions (Linux/Unix servers)
```bash
chmod 600 .env
chown www-data:www-data .env  # or appropriate web server user
```

## Important Security Notes

1. **NEVER commit `.env` file to version control**
2. **NEVER expose `.env` file via web server** (ensure it's not publicly accessible)
3. **Regularly rotate passwords** especially if there's any suspicion of compromise
4. **Use strong passwords** with special characters, numbers, and mixed case
5. **Monitor access logs** for any suspicious activity

## Testing the Configuration

To verify the email configuration is working:
1. Submit a test message through the contact form
2. Check that emails are being sent successfully
3. Monitor `contact-errors.log` for any SMTP authentication errors

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Enable 2FA** on the email account if not already enabled
2. **Use application-specific passwords** if available from your email provider
3. **Implement rate limiting** to prevent abuse (already configured)
4. **Regular security audits** of the codebase for other potential vulnerabilities
5. **Consider using a secrets management service** for production deployments

## Emergency Response

If credentials are compromised again:
1. Immediately change the password on the email provider's website
2. Update the `.env` file with the new password
3. Clear any cached credentials
4. Review access logs for unauthorized usage
5. Consider implementing additional security measures
